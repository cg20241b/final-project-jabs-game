# JABS The Wanderer

## About Game

In this final project, players will enter a world hit by a deadly virus outbreak that has turned most of the human population into zombies. Players will assume the role of one of the few survivors and must rely on their marksmanship, survival strategies and limited resources to survive in a dangerous environment.

The game is a survival-shooter type where players must explore zombie-infested areas, searching for supplies, weapons, and medical kits while dealing with increasingly intense waves of zombie attacks. In addition to dealing with zombies, players must also manage necessities such as stamina, health, and ammunition. Every decision is important as it can affect the chances of survival.


Main Feature:

1. **Survival Mode**: Players must survive as long as possible against waves of zombie attacks that get harder with each level. The longer you survive, the more rewards you get.

2. **Open World Exploration**: Players can explore ruined cities, abandoned military bases, and other places full of dangers in search of supplies.

3. **Weapon Customization**: Players can upgrade their weapons and change their equipment to increase their effectiveness in surviving against zombies.

4. **Resource Management**: Ammunition, food, and medicine are limited, so players must carefully organize and choose when to use them.

> **End Goal**: Survive as long as possible against zombie attacks while trying to explore a new world.

## Game Mechanics

1. **Crafting**

Beggars can't be choosers. Players need to utilize whatever they find to survive. 

2. **Limited Resource**
   
In this chaotic world, there is no getting in and getting out. Think twice (or three) before making a decision. Use the equipment players find to protect or kill.

3. **Adaptive Difficulty**
   
Players are just ordinary everyday people, but the environment can force them to adapt, or die.

## Tools

1. Game Engine
Unity 3D: The primary engine used for building 2D/3D games. It supports physics, rendering, animations, and C# scripting.

2. Tools
Visual Studio: An IDE for writing C# code with Unity.
Unity Profiler: Analyzes performance, memory usage, and optimization.

3. Packages
ProBuilder: For modeling 3D objects inside Unity.
Cinemachine: Adds dynamic camera behavior.
Post Processing Stack: Improves graphics with effects like bloom, motion blur, etc.

## Resources & References

The resources that will be used in this project are as follows:

1. Environment Generator (as the main asset in developing the environment)
2. Unity Asset Store (to obtain the kits and assets needed)
3. Unity Learn (the main reference in creating game mechanics)
4. Unity's Post-processing Stack (post-processing enhancements for a more immersive experience)
5. Forums and YouTube (detailed discussion and code enhancements on implementation) 5.
